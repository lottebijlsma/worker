# Welcome to worker! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thibmaek/worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thibmaek/worker)
> Getting your macOS machine up and running!

Worker is a personal project to quickly get new or clean installed macOS machines
up and running with everything I need for my development workflow.

It currently presets all of the following:
* [macOS sensible defaults](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos)
* [Brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) (with casks)
* Node (trough [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) (with global packages trough npm)
* Ruby (trough [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
* Python (trough [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv))
* Go (trough [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm))
* [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) (with apm packages & themes)

This is great for setting up the tools you need. If you need to tweak the shell you might want to look into [my dotfiles](https://github.com/thibmaek/dotfiles).

### Installing
Just running it from the top is easy:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thibmaek/worker
worker/worker.sh
```

`worker.sh` is the file that points your shell to each specific module.
If you want to turn certain modules of, just comment them out from `worker.sh`

If you want to you can also install this on a file-per-file base, just run the .sh files inside of the modules directory. The extensions directory installs additional content to the modules.

### Modifying
No problem forking this over to your own account, but don't bother sending a PR because I won't merge it unless it's a bug fix (though I prefer to use the issues on this repo for that.)

#### Testing
This project uses shellcheck for linting bash styles & convention to make it safer and easier to work with over multiple contributors. Main use is that it runs on the CI server, but you can test locally and lint directly in the editor as well:

```console
sudo apt install shellcheck # üêß Linux
brew install shellcheck # üçé macOS

./test.sh (runscript for shellcheck worker.sh sample.worker.local ./**/*.sh)
```
